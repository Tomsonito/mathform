        Welcome to my personal website, a project dedicated to practicing and enhancing my skills in web development.
        This
        site was designed with the primary goal of offering a useful tool for calculating the perimeter and area of
        geometric shapes including squares, triangles, and circles. Through the development of this site, I have had the
        opportunity to apply and refine my knowledge of HTML and CSS, focusing on creating a functional, user-friendly
        interface that serves a practical purpose.
        <br><br>
        One of the core features of this site is its ability to handle various calculations with accuracy and
        efficiency.
        Users can input the necessary dimensions for different shapes, and the site will provide precise calculations
        for
        the perimeter and area. This practical application demonstrates my capability to build web tools that are not
        only
        functional but also reliable. The project is a testament to my commitment to ensuring that users have access to
        accurate and helpful information.
        <br><br>
        Incorporating user feedback is a crucial aspect of this project. I highly value the suggestions and comments
        from
        visitors, as they play a significant role in enhancing the site's functionality and design. Your input helps me
        identify areas for improvement and implement changes that make the site more effective and enjoyable to use. I
        am
        dedicated to continuously evolving the site based on the feedback I receive, striving to offer an ever-improving
        experience for all users.
        <br><br>
        This project also serves as a valuable opportunity for me to stay up-to-date with current web development
        practices
        and trends. By working on this site, I can explore new design approaches and refine my skills in creating
        accessible
        and responsive web applications. It allows me to experiment with different techniques and tools, ensuring that
        my
        skills remain relevant and sharp in the rapidly evolving field of web development.
        <br><br>
        I am grateful for your visit and any feedback you may provide. Your support and insights are immensely
        appreciated
        and contribute significantly to my growth as a web developer. This project is not only a way for me to practice
        my
        skills but also a means to deliver a valuable and well-crafted tool that others can benefit from.
        <br><br>
        Thank you once again for your interest in my website. I am excited to continue improving and expanding this
        project,
        and I look forward to incorporating your suggestions to make it even better. Your engagement is a key factor in
        helping me achieve my goal of creating a high-quality, functional, and user-friendly web tool.
